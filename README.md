# Predicting the football match winner using LSTM model of Recurrent Neural Networks

This repository contains the code for a conference paper **"Predicting the football match winner using LSTM model of Recurrent Neural Networks"** that we wrote. This paper gives an introduction to the advantages of using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) Cell in a Recurrent Neural Network and uses it to predict the outcome of a football match.
